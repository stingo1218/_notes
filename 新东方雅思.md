## 雅思精听

**精听适用人群**：
至少把王陆语料库听过一两遍并且70%单词认识，不然精听都是在背新单词就无意义了

**精听需要的材料**

1. 草稿纸
2. 本子（记录和复盘）
3. 黑笔红笔
4. 一两本雅思书

**精听步骤**：（很重要！！！建议仔细看看原视频！！） 

1. 播放一句听力（最好是做过的题），点击暂停，暂停后的一秒钟反应全句内容，养成习惯

2. 草稿纸上写下整句话，一字不落越快越好

3. 自己没听出来的部分，反复放；在笔记本上用个总方法（音标/中文）真实记录自己听到的读音 

4. 打开原文，再放这个部分，对比我们脑海中的读音和实际读音，根据记录和原声，反复仿读，知道你自己读的和原问读得一样

5. 发现差异的点记录在笔记本上，每日反复仿读，复盘是最重要的一步

**三个注意事项**：

1. 光听不写=原地踏步
2. 过早放弃=学半天也没提分
3. 光做不复盘=没做


**老师的重要回复**：
听力6.5以及以上可以直接听section3，4（前提一定是听过语料库），6.5以下但听过语料库大概60%都会的，可以听section1，2，没听过语料库与5分以下的童鞋，请不要精听，没什么太大意义，事倍功半，去听语料库

**策略**：

保前两篇，争最后一篇

做题先顺序,后乱序(和行文顺序一样的先做,乱序的后做)

抓住简单,后做难

**规律**:

- 简答填空(难度低,通常顺序)
- 选择判断(难度中)(顺序出题)
- 标题和其他匹配题(最难)(乱序居多,特征匹配会顺序)

**组合规律**:

1. 判断+填空 90%
2. 
   1. 难度题+其他组合
   2. 信息匹配+其他
   3. 标题匹配+其他
3. 题型组合分布规律不定

## 结构阅读法

**<u>结构阅读法</u>:**(适用于不考标题题的文章)

1. 略读文章掌握大意 1-3min
2. 确定做题顺序,理解题目并且筛选定位词
3. 扫读文本寻找定位词
4. 对照原文确保答案

**略读&扫读:**

*略读*:每段大意

*扫读*:找特殊信息

--------------------------

**步骤**

1. 略读文章掌握大意
   1. 速读<u>标题</u>&<u>开头段</u>确认话题
   2. 主体段
      - 短段落-读首句并且预测后文
      - 长段落-读前两句并预测后文
   3. 浏览结尾段得出结论

**略读的核心**:

1. 抓句子主干(谁做了什么)
2. 复杂句中主句是月度重点
3. 没有必要阅读或理解所有内容
4. 目的是寻找大意或者住址
5. 对文章结构有一个___

**定位词**:

1. `人名,数字,时间,专有名词`等特殊词
2. `低频词`
3. `具体名词>动词>形容词`
4. `限定词+抽象名词`*(increasing population,improved irrigation systems)*

-------------------------

**总结:**

1. 浏览标题首段
2. 主体段

   1. 短-读第一句预测后文
   2. 长-读前两句后两句并预测后文
3. 浏览尾端
4. 审题定位做题

   1. 利用文章篇章和段落结构信息预测大致段落
5. 审题定位做题

   1. 利用题目本身定位词完成精确句子定位
6. 精读题目对应句解题


## 平行阅读法

**标题匹配题特点**

- 文章之前出现
- 选项多余段落
- 不会原词不变

**标题匹配考频**

难度最大,比例最小

总结能力,忽略能力,同义词能力

**标题匹配做题流程**

1. 理解选项识别关键
   1. 大部分都是加定语修饰的名词
2. 略读段落抓大意
   1. 抓取句子**主干信息**
   2. 复杂句中**主句**是重点
   3. 没有必要阅读或理解所有内容
   4. 目的是寻找**大意**或**主旨**
3. 比对答案,难题置后

**标题匹配总结:**

1. **主题句**--一句话总结

2. **方向性**--借助句间关系连接词

3. 

   

**Tips**:

- 优先识别主题句或总结段落中心
- 按照主题句或中心与选项对应
- 如果没有主体对应的选项,可以按照内容最佳匹配性选取

**平行阅读法步骤:**

1. 略读一段选择本段标题
2. 审查文后其他题型前两题
3. 在刚略读过的段落中定位是否有这两题
4. 浏览下一段选择标题并继续判断后方题目是否在本段可对应

**Tips2**:

段间承上启下,利用上下两段判断本段

**Tips3**:

正确选项不一定原词对应,可能是文章例子的总结

开头出现however一般整段都是however后面的大意

**平行阅读法总结:**

1. 适合考生查标题题的文章
2. 

## 主题句

主题句特点

*Computer can be used in different ways*

- 告诉读者作者表达的中心思想
- 对段落内容的一句话总结
- 主题句子之后的句子都是对主题内容的解释和阐述
- 主题句必须有一个中心思想

## 转折

**句首转折**:

本段走势,中心句(非主题句)

**句末转折**:

比较前一句判断是否改变讨论话题

**第二三句转折**:

非常重要(可能否定前几句)

### 转折词总结

**强转折**

but however yet nevertheless whereas

**让步句前后**

even if even though although despite in spite of as倒装 while句首 notwithstanding

**相反类**

in contrast, on the contrary, conversely

**隐性**

unfortunately on the other hand, in fact/reality/as a matter of fact

## 句子间的同反关系

#### 同向类型

举例 解释 并列 指代 递进 列举,次序 应该 类比

|                                                              |                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| for example/instance                                         | 定从,破折号,冒号,that is(to say),in other words,namely |
| and,also,too,as well                                         | this/that/it/such...                                   |
| what's more,at the same time, futhermore,moreover,besides,in addition,additionally,meanwhile | then,finally/eventually                                |
| 因为becuz/as/since/for;所以so/hence/therefore/thus consequently/for this reason/as a result | similarly,likewise,int the same way                    |

#### 反向类型

句间让步 of cuz

转折

对比unlike,different,distinguish...from

隐含矛盾(paradoxically,surprisingly,ironically)

时间发展变化差异/大众观点vs少数观点

- it has been long thought that..
- it used to be...
- \traditionally/once
- it is widely accepted that...

## 标题题

- section可能不止一段
- 包含的每个段落主题内容的方向上具有一致性
- 主旨通常可通过各段首句综合出来

> **6. 任何题目的选项必须在段落里面找到同意替换**
>
> 任何你选的选项，必须要在段落里面标记出对用的同意替换，如果没有，说明你基本做错了。

> ## 基本做题顺序
>
> \1. 删除题目中给出的Example，不仅要在题目中删除，对用的段落标记记得也要删除。因为考试的时候很紧张，你会忘的，多读一遍浪费时间。
>
> \2. 画出题目中的关键词，通过两三个单词，涵盖住整句话意思，让题目更有重点。
>
> \3. 读完一段后，从i-xi的关键词挨个过，问自己段落里面有没有提这些关键词的内容，如果有，那么写下来；如果明确压根没有，那么排除；如果不知道有没有，模模糊糊的，视为有，写下来。
>
> \4. 留下来的选项里面，你自己判断上其实会有倾向的。比如说A段留下来i和ii，然后i是因为你不知道段落到底有没有说，但是ii你知道确实说了，那么讲你更倾向的选项记录在前列，为ii，i。
>
> \5. 每一个段落均重复上述操作，核心是排除不正确的选项，留下可能正确的选项，留下排除不了的选项，段落不知道在说什么没关系，你知道没说什么即可。
>
> \6. 全部段落读完后，使用交叉删除，删除重复选项。
>
> \7. 如果出现交叉删除无法删除的选项，选择能找到同义替换的，如果没有，交给命运吧。
>
> \8. 再次确认每个题目的选项有同意替换支撑



**Tips:**

1. 标题题考查考生对于段落大意进行 **总体理解和把握** 的能力
2. 不可只用文中**某个句子,某几个单词**就仓促对应
3. 原文中遇到段意标题的**原词**要谨慎
4. 切莫跌入**细节**的局限

*In some foreign countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.*

*Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?*

**Advantages** 

1.widen one’s horizons /have a broader view of life

2.accumulate working experience

3.become more independent

4.relieve the strain and stress



1.widen one’s horizons /have a broader view of life

> Spending some time travelling to other places enables those students to broaden their horizons, because they have an opportunity to communicate with people from different backgrounds and learn about the local culture and conventions. As a result, there would be of great value to their both life and work in the future.

2.accumulate working experience

> Taking one-year off enables younger people to accumulate some working experience. Consequently, there would be a clear perspective of their career development, as they can apply their theoretical knowledge to practices in workplace, which makes them more certain about the choice of major and work. 

3.become more independent

> -Young adults tend to become more independent. Since they are separated from their parents and teachers, it is likely to stimulate the ability of independent thinking to cope with issues properly when emergencies occur in the trip or work.

4.relieve the strain and stress

> Taking a year off can relieve the strain and stress triggered by academic study. As a result, those tired-out high school graduates would feel refreshed, which boosts their energy devoted into future study in university. 

**Disadvantages** 

1.waste time and harvest nothing

2.find it difficult to readapt to an academic environment 

3.fail to keep step with their classmates/peers

4.be led astray



1.waste time and harvest nothing

> Due to the fact that young adults are too immature to draw on their gap year, they may waste the valuable time and harvest nothing at the end, or worse, it presents some risks that they could end up not returning to campus.

2.find it difficult to readapt to an academic environment

> A relatively undisciplined atmosphere during working or travelling for a year leads directly to the deprivation of both study ability and motivation. As a result, those school leavers may find it difficult to readapt to an academic environment.

> There is no doubt that paying costs to the education can bring quite a number of benefits. Firstly, investing funding into education does have an good impact on the economy, because it develops the quality of the education, which would be of great benefits to professional competence of the people who are educated. Only in this way can the government makes them performance better and contribute more to the economic market in the workplace. Besides,**government paying education makes(没有提到topic words,不严格扣题)** more genius will be recruited by the research institute. Consequently, the country's technology will have access to better development, as the government are able to collect more professionals. 
>
> However, it can not be neglected that the disadvantages still remain. First and foremost, paying too much to he education will lead to the insufficient investment to other industries such as  construction which would soon have difficulties getting development and cause laid-off trend. In addition, the country would also be curbed by hegemonic foreign countries like USA. Therefore the country strength could hardly be increased, which caused by ignorance about development of army and economy as the government pays too much attention to the education.
>
> **范文**
>
> It is admitted that it may be a challenge if governments offer to pay all the expenses from children’s education. Apart from education, governments play a significant role in constructing other public services, where there is also a large amount of investment needed. Consequently, the financial burden would be certainly increased. In addition, when education becomes easily accessible with the funding by governments, it is likely to make children or their parents take it for granted, which means they may not value the chance of getting education, leading to a waste of booking and teaching resources. 
>
> However, giving financial aid on children’s education brings about a more rewarding consequence. In most counties, those children from poor or rural areas find it hard to have access to schools as a result of strained financial circumstances, where the sponsorship by the local government is able to improve such situation. Also, when the government’s subsidies help more children get well-educated, the quality of citizens will be enhanced, which ultimately makes a contribution to the stability in society, because there would be a decline in the crime rate, if all individuals get employed in their occupations by applying their professional skills acquired in schools.

> It is argued that the amount of violence in films and on television ought to be decreased for reducing the level of violent crime in society. While I agree that there is a need to regulate the number of violence in films and on television, I do not believe that this approach can achieve its goal as expected.
>
> There are serval reasons why managing the amount of violence in films and on television can help control the violent crime level. First and foremost, such violent images in films and on television could be detrimental to audience's psychology,as they are portrayed as extreme as possible to attract audiences which would mislead people's outlook and values and make them tend to be more aggressive in daily life. Moreover, audience will gradually lose their ability of distinguishing right from wrong, thus leading to imitating the violent behavior in the film or on the television.
>
> However, there still be other reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, the motivation of people committing crimes  does not only come from films and televisions. Mental health has something to do with a number of crimes. For example, quite many juveniles with high study anxiety who are rebellious against their parents or teachers are more likely to commit crimes due to their mental problems. Besides,  economic backwardness can cause plenty problems in people's livelihood which would become the hotbed of crime. Therefore, those who can not afford a home or food are forced to commit crimes to make a living.
>
> In conclusion, although the violence in films and on television is relating to violent crime,I believe that the government has to do more to solve this problem.**避免sth new**
>
> **范文**
>
> It is argued that violent movies and TV works are the major reason why an increasing number of people committing a crime. While I agree that strict control of the amount of violence on media could work in decreasing the rate of crimes, there are other ways that should be taken into consideration. 
>
> It is no deny that violence on screen indeed has a negative effect on people’s behaviour. To attract audiences, it is common that the violent images in films or on TV programmes is portrayed as extreme as possible, which might be detrimental to viewers’ mental health and even mislead their life outlook and values if there is long-time exposure to the violent shows. In addition to that, during a formative period, teenagers are prone to imitate what they have seen or experienced, due to a lack of mature ability of distinguishing right from wrong. As a consequence, they might be launched on a path of anti-social behaviour and that is also the reason why the rate of juvenile delinquency is on a rise. 
>
> However, there are also other measures to take in decreasing the violent crime in society. Government should play a significant role in strengthening regulatory activities, including the installment of surveillance cameras in public places, thus reducing the possibility of potential crimes. Also, family education is indispensable in terms of decreasing the crime rate, especially for youth crimes. According to research, children living in a single-parent family or divorced family are more likely to be autistic and go to extremes, even breaking a law just to grab attention. Therefore, sufficient concern from parents is extremely vital to children’s conduct. 
>
> In conclusion, although it is necessary for government to take actions on the control of violence on media to reduce the crimes, strict laws and family education are also important.

> People have different views about whether travelling abroad to learn about foreign countries. While some people argue that there is necessary to travel to another country to know about it, I believe that it can also be achieved through TV and the internet.
>
> It is widely admitted that it does be of great importance to travel abroad to learn about other foreign countries. First and foremost, the travelers might get more impressive acknowledge about other foreign countries, as they can communicate with the local people placed in such environment. From the chatting with different people such as drivers and waiters, they would get to understand the difference in language habit between the two foreign countries. Besides, they could have a better opportunity to experience the local live, through visiting local bars and markets or any other places. Moreover, the knowledge of this country would not be theory no longer, because they have a access to meet some person who can help them update the way they used to think. More activities they have never seen before are open to them. For instance, firing practice is not allowed in a number of foreign countries, while they can travel to another country to ~~attempt(强调努力)~~try this activity.
>
> However, there still be someone who deems that TV and internet can do the same opposing this opinion. Firstly, studying knowledge about other foreign countries from TV or internet costs almost nothing,while the travelers have to pay a large bill to the journey, as the development of economy differs from country to country, which leads to a cup of coffee in one country doubling the price of another country's. The internet and TV really can involve a wide range of knowledge about various foreign countries. As long as the user can use search engine, they can easily find the information they are eager to know. What's more, the existence of mobile phone enable everyone study foreign country everywhere even in the bus.

With the rapid development of high[1]tech devices, it is easier for journalists to collect information of a country by the means of taking pictures or videos, which can be broadcast on TV and Internet in high definition, thus making it possible for people to view them at home rather than traveling abroad. **<u>Besides</u>**, the information posted on Internet is in multi-aspects, where people can choose the content according to their own interest, as well as those unlikely to know just by tours.

> The majority of visitors of museums and historical sites are tourists instead of local people. There are several reasons accounting for this phenomenon, but local people could have interests in these sites through a number of methods.
>
> The lack of local visitors in museums and historical sites is caused by several reasons. Most of the local think that these historical spots are too boring to visit because they have already known a lot about their local history, therefore there is no need to have a visit. Even though they would have visited one historical spot, they would still have no idea what they are looking at, as the little information offered about the item on display. Moreover,the pricey entry fees are problems. Consequently, local people would not choose the museums or historical sites to visit, as they can have a better cost-effective choice such as amusement park, cinema and cafe.
>
> However, in order to solve this problem, many measures could be taken. Firstly, the recreation activities ought to be set, which containing constructing some sightseeing such as parks and gardens. Telling historical story in different ways like media,virtual reality and electronic games could also be of use. What's more, the **visitor(改成local people,不然不扣题)** should be pleasant given a gift as a souvenir. Moreover, the involvement of government could have great effects on the announcement, as the free-admission could be permitted. Meanwhile, the publicity of the museums and historical sites could separated widely through short video, broadcast and messages.

> There is a phenomenon that museums and historical attractions are increasingly appreciated by tourists from other cities and countries, however, seldom by local residents. While a variety of factors can lead to this situation, some measures can be taken. 
>
> There are several reasons why local people are reluctant to visit the museums and historical sites. Firstly, familiarity breeds boredom. Compared with the vast majority of outsiders, whose purpose for travelling is to explore the cultural deposits of a new city, it is hard to evoke the mental pleasure or visual enjoyment to the locals. In other words, having sufficient money and energy, they prefer to satisfy themselves with other recreation activities rather than have a sightseeing in local places of interest. Furthermore, the policies executed by government are more in favor of foreign tourists, because of the considerable amount of revenue from tourism section, thus contributing to the flourishing economic development of this city. 
>
> However, some approaches can be adopted in terms of how to inspire local residents’ interest in visiting local museums and historic spots. First and preferential policies have a rewarding effect, which means people living in local area can pay for the entrance tickets at a discounted price, or even the free-admission policy can be carried out on some special days. Secondly, it is feasible for the mass of media to strengthen the publicity of local tourist attractions, where the unique historic culture is more likely to grasp attention of the locals. Lastly, despite the major function is to educate people with history and traditional culture, a museum would be more attractive if various entertaining elements could be added. For example, virtual reality can be applied to present the content with vivid images and sound instead of text description.

> In conclusion, although the causes for not visiting historical sites cannot be ignored, intriguing indigenous people’s interest as well as effective policies can play an indispensable role in address this issue.

> It is considered by some people that usage of printed copies such as newspapers or books will become to end due to the vast advancement of technology, particularly these unpaid websites online have huge number of information for customers, however, in my opinion, I believe that it will never stop completely due to certain reasons.  On the one hand, the younger generation started highly depending on online materials for everything due to the convenience. In other words, in many countries, youngsters have their own appliances to search for all information in one place for reading books and all type of local and international news even without spending any money. To illustrate this, particularly for me, I enjoy reading all sorts of cricket news from a specific website at any time without charging even though I can not find all cricket-related news from a particular newspaper. Therefore, printed materials would have replaced by online materials. On the other hand, we can not expect all the online resources will be displayed for free of charge. In fact, in present days, most published books from famous authors are limited to certain websites like amazon and that should be paid to purchase. Otherwise, even if we accessed any websites illegally that would be certainly harmful to our privacy. Valuable information would require a certain amount even in the future.  To conclude, I disagree with the concern. Although online resources are easier to get all the facts, they will not be displayed freely in the future because valuable things are never available for the free amount in this money-oriented world.

> Friend bought. From UK. Soldier's uniform in WWII. Auctioned by soldier's family. Bought for 300 ponds. Wear every day. I want everyone to see. quite warm  suitable for the winter     This coat is longer than one meter  I can see that the owner was a tall man .quite shabby   can hardly see orinaly camel coulor due to those burnt color caused by gunpower.  . There are also several bullet holes,what a  pity for the orininal soldier. The hooks for the grenade are also preserved well. The rust on the hook tells the history of this caot. This coat has witnessed brutal war. Looking at this dress, I fell into contemplation,. lucky me live in peaceful world.  I hope there will be no more wars in this world.

#### 早起的经历

![image-20220126102704866](https://gitee.com/yonaspigeon/giteepicstore/raw/master/master/20220126102705.png)

> I used to be a high school student in Hebei. Our school is famous for its brutal militarized management in China. Our principal forced us to gather at the playground at 5 o'clock every day. Even in the winter when the sun had not risen yet. I had to get up at 4:30. It was quite painful because we also slept very late every day, we had to study at night until eleven o'clock, so that's to say our sleep time was only six and a half hours at most. Quite many people suffered from depression due to  this. We tried to report such condition to the bureau of education. But the officer never response.  I think these managers had lost their minds. I can't take it any more that they disregard students' lives and health for the sake of students' grades. I desperately hope that the government can regulate such phenomenon, because there are  a increasing number of high school trying to imitate our school. It has arouse a trend of driving students to study in a tough way. Such condition will continue if we don't do sth to stop this.

- 思路1:  **万能理由: physical/mental**
- 思路2:**给出原因+->可能造成的结果**

> 
>
> **Control of the Laws of Physics**: The reason why people enjoy these sports are that they are normally played, exercised or practiced in free or uncontrolled environment like base jumping and sky diving. It means while traditional athletes play in controlled environment like fields and gyms. **Extreme athletes have to operate and display their skills in free-flowing natural environment**. **For this reason the aspects and understanding of laws of physics and how to apply and use them are really crucial for success.**
>
> **Thrill**: This is the single **most attractive factor in people’s interest for extreme sports**. **The adrenaline rush is what differentiates it from any other type of sports**. The thrill that is derived in extreme sports is highest. **The athletes are fully exposed and at the mercy of direct danger**. The catch is how to maintain composure and apply skills when it is in extreme scenario. Extreme sports are also widely condemned for the same reason. **As many don’t think it is a game to put one’s self in harm’s way with full throttle, without understanding the intensity of consequences.**
>
> **Pushing The Limits**: Extreme sports as the name goes is about pushing the limits. The balance and control of regular instincts application is tried in the highest pressure scenario. The response, nerves and the grip over the un-controllable is the main zeal why people who play or watch, enjoy it.
>
> Man against Nature: As we mentioned earlier that they are about natural elements- Air, Water and Land. These games are loved because the natural elements react to human extreme or instincts. The [passion](http://www.selfgrowth.com/passion.html) of man to overcome the natural barriers is an [addiction](http://www.selfgrowth.com/addict.html) for these athletes and spectators. Many a time these overtures have dire impacts, but the fear of danger is the prime motivator to excel in its skill.
>
> Some of the mainstream extreme sports are base jumping, bungy jumping, sky diving, gliding, extreme skiing, mountain biking, cliff-diving, scuba diving, wind surfing. No matter what extreme sport you may enjoy know your limits, or you’ll be pushed.
