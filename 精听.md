we'll begin with some basics. Firstly,what do we learn by studying geography? Well, we learn a great deal of all processes about that affect and continue to affect the earth surface. But we learnt far more than that because study geography also inform us the different kinds of the relationships that develop between the particular environment and people that lived there. Okay, we like to think geography ~~**is**~~ **as** having two main branches.  There's a study of the nature of our planet it's physics features what it actually looks like and then it's the study of the ~~**wise**~~ **ways** which we choose to live and the impact **of** those on our planet. Our current use of carbon **~~filled~~** **fuels** is a good example of that. But there are more specific study areas to consider too , and we will be looking at each of these~~term~~ **in turn** throughout the semester. These included by ~~**a physical geography**~~ biophysical geography, by which i mean the study of the natural environment and all its living things. Then ~~this~~**there's** to ~~**pography**~~ **topography** , that looks **at** the shapes **of**  the land **and** oceans(蓝的欧圣斯).
