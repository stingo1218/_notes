 ok grage. i finally read the article you mentioned---the one about the study on ???  physicis. about the study of college students stand by ???. yeah i was interested that the researches were actually mixes of phychologys and physicses. that's an unusual compaantion. yeah. i got a little confused at first about which student the research was based on? they actually won't major in physics,they will major in what's known the ???. That's science,technology,engineering and math. yes, but they are all doing physics courses as part of their studies. that's correct. so as i understood, miaky and col start it from the fact that women are under represented in introductory physics courses in college, and also that on average, the women who do roll on this courses perform more poorly than men. no one really knows why is this case. yeah,but what the research want to find out is basically what they can do about the relatively low level of the women results, but inorder to find the solution they need to find more about the nature problem. right,let we see what i can remember, it was in the physics class, the female students thought the male students all assumed, the women wont any good physics, is that it? and they think that the men expect them to get poor result in tests. that's what the women thought made them nervous, so they did poor results. but actually they were wrong,no one make assumption on female students at all.anyway, what ??? do was quiet simple,getting the students do some writing before they went into the physics class. what did they call it?   value information,they have to write essay to focus on things significant to them. not particularly to do with the subject they were studying but more general things like music or people who matter to them. right, so the idea of doing this research is to get the students think in a positive way. and put this thoughts to words can relight them and help them overcome the psychological factors that led to poor performance. yeah. but what the researchers in this research hasn't take expected was the one activity raise women's physics grades from the c to the b range.a huge change.pity was to  an a but still. nobody does suggest the women seriously underperforming beforehand in comparison with a man.yes, mine do. M??'s article left out a lot of detail like did the students just do the writhing just once or several times and how them told why they doing this. that may affect the results. you mean,if they know the research is thought to might help them improve. then they just try to  fulfill the exceptation. exactly.
