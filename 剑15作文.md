It is true that people are more willing to own a house rather than to rent a house in some countries.There are various reasons why people prefer owning to renting.

There are several reasons why I think this situation is negative.Firstly,with the situation of people preferring to own a house,the houses available for purchase will become fewer and fewer.For example,the downtown houses are harder to purchase because enormous people are willing to purchase houses downtown because there are more convenient for them to go to work or school.Secondly,purchasing a house will consume a large bill of money,and this will lead the deposit you can control to become less.What's more serious is that the purchaser may carry a loan.Finally,after owning a house means you can never live anywhere you want to live.

On the other hand,owning a house is a more economical means.Because owning a house means that you people don't have to pay for the rent every month.After owning a house,people can decorate it as what they want it to be.For example,somebody prefers chinese decoration while others like western-style decoration.And the most important thing is that the price of houses is increasingly growing nowdays,so purchasing a house is a decision which will not make people lose their money.Owning a house is meaningful for those who wants a stable life,because people don't have to  run around with owning a house.

In conclusion,I do not believe that it is a positive situation generally in nowadays.

4.Conclusion:

> People prefer to read online



People in future are willing to read something they are interested in online rather than buy newspapers printed in newsstands. I completely agree with the idea that people will choose to read the things online instead of buying newspapers printed offline.

There are several reasons why people are not willing to buy printed newspapers. Firstly,they have to pay a bill for them offline in newsstands .However,it's hard to see some newsstands in cities. Most newsstands are now fading away because the regulation of the cities which are now running. Secondly,the newspapers are difficult to carry with when people are going to work,they have to spare some space in their bags to store the newspapers. Finally,manufacturing printed newspapers requires a mass of materials such as wood and ink.

I believe that reading things online can replace buying newspapers offline  someday in the future. It is much cheaper than buying a newspaper. People are willing to pay nothing while they are reading the news online. Furthermore,reading online is very convenient for people. They can read everywhere and all the time if they would like to. There is no need for them to take with newspapers or books while they are moving from one place to another place. Last but not least,using mobile devices to read online can also protect the environment by reducing the materials like wood in the process of manufacture.

In conclusion,my view is that reading online will replace buying newspapers and books offline in the future and this is good for us and environment.

The diagram illustrates the process of instant noodles production.

We can see that instant noodles are made using three main raw materials,and that the manufacturing process consists of four distinct platforms. It requires eight steps to turn flour into instant noodles.

At the first stage in the production of instant noodles,the flour is brought to the mixer. Next, flour, water, oil are mixed together in the mixer and then put on the rollers. The dough sheets can then be sent to be cut into small strips. The strips will then gather as noodles discs and get into the oil which is at high temperature. Finally, after drying, these discs can be sent to next stage to be packaged.

The packaging stage begins with the process that vegetables ,spices and noodles are put into the cups. The cups can then be pasted with labels and sealed. Finally,the instant noodles can be sent to be sold.
